Simple HTTP Monitoring
======================

This script aims at monitoring W3C complient HTTP logs and show miscellaneous informations about what's going on.

To test it, download, `npm install` then `npm start` (of course you'll need node & npm).

TODO :

- decide which stats could be interesting : top 100 IP, max response time, number of 5** requests. 
- fetch and display those stats
