Simple HTTP Monitoring
======================

This script aims at monitoring W3C complient HTTP logs and show miscellaneous informations about what's going on.

To test it, download, `npm install` then `npm start` (of course you'll need node & npm).

Suggestions of other interesting stats : 
- fail2ban-like
- most important locations (based on IP)
- number/percentage of server errors
- flapping detection if too much triggers/cancel in less than x minutes.
