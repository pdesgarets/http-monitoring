Simple HTTP Monitoring
======================

This script aims at monitoring W3C complient HTTP logs and show miscellaneous informations about what's going on.

To test it, download, `npm install` then `npm start` (of course you'll need node & npm).

TODO :

- decide which stats could be interesting
- fetch and display those stats
- tests
- maybe start again from scratch, depending on the perfs and the correctness.
